KMSAuto Net - automatic KMS-activator for operating systems 
Windows VL editions: Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012,
2012 R2 also Office 2010, 2013, 2016.

Additionally, the program activates:
	Windows 8.1 Single Language;
	Windows 8.1 Core;
	Windows 8.1 Core N;
	Windows 8.1 Pro WMC;
	Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry Pro;
	Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard;
	Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter.
It is based on KMS Server Service from mikmik38 (MDL).

  
       		                   Using the program:
                          —————————————————————————————————
Run KMSAuto Net.exe as administrator and use the interface. If you need additional 
program features, enter into Professional Mode. The On/Off Professional Mode button
is placed in the "About" Tab.
The easiest way to use the program is to pick the automatic mode. All you need to do is
click on the button if you want to activate and agree to create a scheduled task for
reactivation by pressing the button.

Tip: First you need to activate Windows and Office in manual mode, and only then, 
when you are sure that the activation takes place, you can create a scheduled task for 
reactivation products every 25 days.
If the system does not want to be activated in Professional Mode go to "Utilites" and 
manually set GVLK key for the proper Windows Edition, and then try to activate again.

			                    Additional Information:
                          —————————————————————————————————

To activate Windows 8.1 the TAP network adapter must be installed directly
and use the IP address 10.3.0.2-254 or use a special driver. All these features
are built into the program.
To activate via LAN, the TAP interface can't be used to install and
activate through an address of a computer in the network.
If you reconfigure the program and it stops operating correctly - check the checkbox 
"Reset the program." All settings will be set by default.


		            Additional parameters of the program (switches):
                          —————————————————————————————————

		  and exit the program.

		  and exit the program.
/log=yes	- Run this program in quiet mode, create a file ActStatus.log
		  and exit the program.
/kmsset=yes	- Run this program in quiet mode, install KMS-Service and exit the program.
 	          It's only for KMS-Service, without TAP, WinDivert, Hook.
/kmsdel=yes	- Run this program in quiet mode, remove KMS-Service and exit the program.
/key=yes	- Run this program in quiet mode, install the Windows key and exit
  	          the program.

   	          Office Activation and exit the program.

/sound=yes	- Enable sounds.
/sound=no	- Disable sounds.
		  
                          —————————————————————————————————
The activation will be done with the settings defined in the tab KMS-Service.


                          —————————————————————————————————
When you transfer the program to another computer, you need to reset the Auto Mode.
Activation would still be in automatic, but the mode may not be optimal
for your new computer.
To reset the auto mode to the initial state you need to switch to any other mode,
and then again select auto. Everything is now reset to the initial state.

	              About how to activate the built-in program				
                          —————————————————————————————————
The program can perform the activation with built-in KMS server Emulator in several
different ways. Why are there several of them?: the standard way to connect to the activation 
server through the local host (127.0.0.2-254) was blocked in Windows 8.1. 
All methods are intended for activation of something to cheat the system, do so
that it "thinks" that the KMS server is not on your computer, but somewhere far away in the 
network.
				  
						  
	           Overview about the operating modes of the program:
                          —————————————————————————————————
Auto	 - the program tries to automatically find the way that best suits your activation
           system. Attempts are being made to activate the system or Office for all admissible
           ways your system has, and the one picked by the program it will be held to remember.
           To reset to the initial mode, you can switch to any other mode and then select Auto. 
	       This mode is selected by default.	
Hook     - method based on the substitution of the original file system changed on a special way.
           The new version of the method works without physically replacing the file.
WinDivert- in the system a driver is installed at the time of activation and it keeps running 
           to emulate a remote connection to the KMS server.	  
NoAuto   - In this mode, there is no automation, there is need to set the way it will work.
           Is intended for people who know better than me what, how and when to do and whether 
           you want to do it or not. :)	
TAP      - the system is a virtual device. TAP activation is done through this virtual device.
           The program includes two drivers for the TAP adapter. If you already installed one of
           the drivers, the program will used the other driver to activate, resulting in your 
           current adapter left intact.		   
* Mode names on the System tab - clicking these links on which you can change some settings.

				KMSSS.exe Options
                          —————————————————————————————————
Command Line Parameters:
  -Port <Port Value> - KMS Port. Range from 1 to 65535
         -PWin <PID> - Windows PID
         -PO14 <PID> - Office 2010 PID
         -PO15 <PID> - Office 2013 PID

      -RI <Interval> - Renewal Interval. Range from 15 to 43200 minutes
              -Debug - Detailed info.
                -Log - Log file Enabled.
		 -IP - Show IP address Clients Computers.         
        -Hwid <HWID> - Machine Hardware Hash.
		   
                          —————————————————————————————————
The program requires .NET Framework 4.5
To run properly, it is necessary to add the file KMSSS.exe in the exclusion of your Anti-Virus!.
Or disable Anti-Virus at the time of activation.

Sometimes KMS-Service is not installed properly, it may be for different reasons.
You need to perform 2-3 times "Removing KMS-Service" and restart your computer.
When working with the program it makes sense to check on the option "Save 
settings in the program folder". In this case, the configuration file will be stored 
in the program folder, and not in the C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\MSfree Inc.

                          —————————————————————————————————
KMS Log Analyzer.xlsm previous versions are incompatible with KMS Server Service v1.1.7
In order to save their old records should be transferred to the new
KMS Log Analyzer using copy-paste function.

			  "I wasn't able to activate!!!"
                          —————————————————————————————————
Perhaps you have a non VL product, not intended for activation of KMS-Service, for instance 
Windows 7 Ultimate can't support KMS activation, or your antivirus blocks the activation.
If an antivirus is the culprit you can do the following: in the "System" tab click on the 
blue label "KMS-Service" and in the window that appears remove the check mark. Then add the 
folder to exceptions in your antivirus program.
                                                                                                                                                                                                          


                          —————————————————————————————————
I want to say thank you mikmik38, without his work this program would be just impossible. 
To Hotbird64, for his KMS Client, Evgeny972 and guys from forum.ru-board.com for making
possible assistance and testing of multiple versions of the program.
